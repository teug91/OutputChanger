Changes default audio device and primary display with hotkeys. Hotkeys can be changed by right clicking tray icon. Keep in mind that this will make it a GLOBAL hotkey, meaning it won't be usable by any other program.

Standard hotkeys are:
* Ctrl + F9 for display.
* Ctrl + F10 for audio.

I use this program in combination with [reWASD](https://www.rewasd.com/), which makes it possible to change make the display/audio changes with a gamedpad.

Also inspired (and very much helped out) from this [blog post](http://spikex.net/2011/05/programmatically-changing-the-default-audio-playback-device-on-windows-vista-windows-7/).
